            "28483577|a|BACKGROUND: The addition of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) to corticosteroids improves asthma control. Cigarette smoke exposure, increasing oxidative stress, may negatively affect corticosteroid responses. The anti-inflammatory effects of formoterol (FO) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) are unknown. AIMS: This study explored whether FP, alone and in combination with FO, in human bronchial epithelial cellline (16-HBE) and primary bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), counteracted some CSE-mediated effects and in particular some of the molecular mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance. METHODS: 16-HBE and NHBE were stimulated with CSE, FP and FO alone or combined. HDAC3 and HDAC2 activity, nuclear translocation of GR and NF-kappaB, pERK1/2/tERK1/2 ratio, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta mRNA expression, and mitochondrial ROS were evaluated. Actin reorganization in neutrophils was assessed by fluorescence microscopy using the phalloidin method. RESULTS: In 16-HBE, CSE decreased expression/activity of HDAC3, activity of HDAC2, nuclear translocation of GR and increased nuclear NF-kappaB expression, pERK 1/2/tERK1/2 ratio, and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. In NHBE, CSE increased mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and supernatants from CSE exposed NHBE increased actin reorganization in neutrophils. FP combined with FO reverted all these phenomena in CSE stimulated 16-HBE cells as well as in NHBE cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides compelling evidences that FP combined with FO may contribute to revert some processes related to steroid resistance induced by oxidative stress due to cigarette smoke exposure increasing the anti-inflammatory effects of FP.\n",

In this Focus Review, we summarize the recent progress in chemically and physically designed biointerfaces with controlled bacterial adhesion. On one hand, several smart-responsive biointerfaces that can be switched between bacteria-adhesive states and bacteria-resistant states by applying an external stimulus have been rationally designed and developed for adhering and detaching bacteria, whilst, on the other hand, the adhesive behavior of bacteria can be controlled by regulating the topography of the biointerface. In addition, new technologies (i.e., biosensors) and materials (i.e., graphene) provide promising approaches for efficiently controlling the adhesion of bacteria for practical applications. \",\n",

A Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilm was used as a sustainable template to form mesoporous Pd structures while eliminating the need for synthetic chemicals. The bulk of the biofilm material was removed by thermal treatments after nanoparticle formation, producing a catalytic Pd mesoporous (pore size 9.7\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.1\\u2009nm) structure attached to the graphite electrode with a 1.5-2\\u2009\\u00b5m thick backbone composed of nanoparticles (\\u223c200\\u2009nm). A control electrode electrochemically plated with Pd in the absence of a biofilm exhibited a variable planar Pd base (\\u223c0.5-3\\u2009\\u00b5m thick) with sporadic Pd extrusions (\\u223c2\\u2009\\u00b5m across, 1-5\\u2009\\u00b5m tall) from the surface. The biotemplated mesoporous structure produced 15-20% higher stable current densities during H2 oxidation tests than the electrochemically plated control electrode, even though 30% less Pd was present in the biotemplated catalyst. These results indicate that electroactive biofilms can be used as a sustainable base material to produce nanoporous structures without the need for synthetic polymers. Biotechnol.

Electrochemical treatment of the anode surface facilitated biofilm formation on the electrode, resulting in rapid and enhanced current production. The maximum current density of the treated anode was 233\\u00b124.2mA/m(2), which was 41% higher than that of the untreated anode. The electron transfer rate also increased from 2.45\\u00b10.04 to 3.0\\u00b10.02\\u03bcmol of electrons/mg of protein\\u00b7min. Biofilm formation on the treated anode was mainly due to the strong hydrogen or peptide bonds between the amide groups of bacterial materials (including cytochrome c) and carboxyl groups formed on the electrodes. These results provide useful information on direct electron transfer by SRB in a mediator-less MFC through cytochrome c and the effects of the electrochemical treatment of electrodes on MFC performance. \",\n",

Microbial electrochemical cell technology can be used to generate electricity, or higher value chemicals, from organic waste. The capability of biofilms of electroactive bacteria to transfer electrons to solid anodes is a key feature of this emerging technology, yet the electron transfer mechanism is not fully characterized as yet. Acetate oxidation current generated from biofilms of an EAB, Geobacter sulfurreducens, on graphite electrodes as a function of time does not correlate with film thickness. Values of film thickness, and the number and local concentration of electrically connected redox sites within Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms as well as a charge transport diffusion co-efficient for the biofilm can be estimated from non-turnover voltammetry. The thicker biofilms, of 50 \\u00b1 9 \\u03bcm, display higher charge transport diffusion co-efficient than that in thinner films, as increased film porosity of these films improves ion transport, required to maintain electro-neutrality upon electrolysis. \",\n",

To completely realize autohydrogenotrophic nitrogen removal, a novel 3-dimensional biofilm-electrode reactor was designed. Titanium was electroplated with ruthenium and used as the anode. Activated carbon fiber felt was used as the cathode. The reactor was separated into two chambers by a permeable membrane. The cathode chamber was filled with granular graphite and glass beads. The cathode and cathode chamber were inhabited with domesticated biofilm. In the absence of organic substances, a nitrogen removal efficiency of up to 91% was achieved at DO levels of 3.42 +/- 0.37 mg/L when the applied current density was only 0.02 mA/cm2. The oxidation of ammonium in biofilm-electrode reactors was also investigated. It was found that ammonium could be oxidized not only on the anode but also on particle electrodes in the cathode chamber of the biofilm-electrode reactor. Oxidation rates of ammonium and nitrogen removal efficiency were found to be affected by the electric current loading on the biofilm-electrode reactor. The kinetic model of ammonium at different electric currents was analyzed by a first-order reaction kinetics equation. The regression analysis implied that when the current density was less than 0.02 mA/cm2, ammonium removal was positively correlated to the current density. However, when the current density was more than 0.02 mA/cm2, the electric current became a limiting factor for the oxidation rate of ammonium and nitrogen removal efficiency.\",\n",

Herein, we show that the self-assembly of graphene oxide and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 formed an electroactive, reduced-graphene-oxide-hybridized, three-dimensional macroporous biofilm, which enabled highly efficient bidirectional electron transfers between Shewanella and electrodes owing to high biomass incorporation and enhanced direct contact-based extracellular electron transfer. This 3D electroactive biofilm delivered a 25-fold increase in the outward current (oxidation current, electron flux from bacteria to electrodes) and 74-fold increase in the inward current (reduction current, electron flux from electrodes to bacteria) over that of the naturally occurring biofilms. \",\n",

Single-crystal gold-Au(110), Au(111), Au(210)-and platinum-Pt(100), Pt(110), Pt(111), Pt(210)-electrodes were tested and compared to graphite rods. G. sulfurreducens electrochemically interacts with all these materials with different attachment kinetics and final current production, although redox species involved in the electron transfer to the anode are virtually the same in all cases. Initial bacterial colonization was fastest on graphite up to the monolayer level, whereas gold electrodes led to higher final current densities. Crystal geometry was shown to have an important influence, with Au(210) sustaining a current density of up to 1442\\u00b1101\\u03bcAcm(-2) at the steady state, over Au(111) with 961\\u00b194\\u03bcAcm(-2) and Au(110) with 944\\u00b189\\u03bcAcm(-2). On the other hand, the platinum electrodes displayed the lowest performances, including Pt(210). Our results indicate that both crystal geometry and electrode material are key parameters for the efficient interaction of bacteria with the substrate and should be considered for the design of novel materials and microbial devices to optimize energy production. \",\n",

In Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms, the controlling steps in current production are thought to be the metabolic activity of cells, but still remain to be determined. By quantifying the DNA, RNA, and protein content during the long-term growth of biofilms on polarized graphite electrodes, we show in this work that current production becomes independent of DNA accumulation immediately after a maximal current is achieved. Indeed, the mean respiratory rate of biofilms rapidly decreases after this point, which indicates the progressive accumulation of cells that do not contribute to current production or contribute to a negligible extent. These results support the occurrence of physiological stratification within biofilms as a consequence of respiratory limitations imposed by limited biofilm conductivity. \",\n",

The critical dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of a platinum-loaded graphite electrode was reported as 2.2 mg/l, about 10-fold higher than an aerobic bacterium. A series of MFCs were run with the cathode compartment inoculated with activated sludge (biotic) or not (abiotic) on platinum-loaded or bare graphite electrodes. At the beginning of the operation, the current values from MFCs with a biocathode and abiotic cathode were 2.3 \\u00b1 0.1 and 2.6 \\u00b1 0.2 mA, respectively, at the air-saturated water supply in the cathode. The current from MFCs with an abiotic cathode did not change, but that of MFCs with a biotic cathode increased to 3.0 mA after 8 weeks. The coulomb efficiency was 59.6% in the MFCs with a biotic cathode, much higher than the value of 15.6% of the abiotic cathode. When the DO supply was reduced, the current from MFCs with an abiotic cathode decreased more sharply than in those with a biotic cathode. When the respiratory inhibitor azide was added to the catholyte, the current decreased in MFCs with a biotic cathode but did not change in MFCs with an abiotic cathode. The power density was higher in MFCs with a biotic cathode (430 W/m(3) cathode compartment) than the abiotic cathode MFC (257 W/m(3) cathode compartment). Electron microscopic observation revealed nanowire structures in biofilms that developed on both the anode and on the biocathode. These results show that an electron consuming bacterial consortium can be used as a cathode catalyst to improve the cathode reaction. \",\n",

In this study, an ion-pairing chromatography-porous graphitic carbon column coupled with a time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IP-PGC-TOF/MS) system was developed for targeted and untargeted profiling of metabolites involved in biofilm and planktonic growth of C. albicans. Using untargeted profiling analysis, 16 differential metabolites were screened and identified as potential biomarkers, most of which were amino acids or related compounds. Based on untargeted profiling analysis, targeted quantitative analysis of 22 amino acids was established and carefully evaluated using stable isotope-labeled internal standards. Among them, 9 amino acids that were not screened by untargeted profiling were further characterized as new biomarkers. Finally, a total of 25 potential biomarkers were screened using the combined targeted and untargeted strategy, among which 16 were characterized for the first time. Our results confirmed that amino acid metabolism and polyamine metabolism were at a high level in biofilms, except for some new biomarkers including ornithine, arginine and proline that were directly related to ornithine. Further experiments were carried out on the ornithine decarboxylase-negative (spe1\\u0394) mutant, and the results showed that the consumption of ornithine for putrescine biosynthesis has a significant impact on biofilm formation and may prove to be a drug target for resolving drug resistance of C. albicans. This study provides a systematic view of changes in amino acid metabolism during C. albicans biofilm formation by a combination of targeted and untargeted profiling using an original IP-PGC-TOF/MS method. It is a feasible approach for characterizing subtle variations and screening novel biomarkers from the microbial metabolome.\",\n",

Pure culture electroactive biofilms of Glk. subterraneus were grown during chronoamperometric batch experiments at a graphite electrode poised at +200 mV (vs. SCE) with 10 mM acetate as the electron donor. These biofilms exhibited the highest current density (4.68 \\u00b1 0.54 A m(-2)) reported on a planar material with a pure culture under saline conditions (3.5% NaCl). To investigate possible anodic electron transfer (ET) mechanisms, cyclic voltammetry (CV) of mature visible apparent reddish biofilms was performed under bioelectrocatalytic substrate consumption (turnover) and in the absence of the substrate (non-turnover). CV evidenced a well defined typical sigmoidal shape and a pair of clear redox couples under turnover and non-turnover conditions, respectively. Moreover, the calculation of their formal potentials indicated the presence of a common ET mechanism present in both CV conditions between -427.6 \\u00b1 0.5 (Ef,2) and -364.8 \\u00b1 4.5 mV (Ef,3). Confocal laser scanning microscopy inspection showed a biofilm structure composed of several layers of metabolically active bacteria that spread all over the electrode material within a biofilm up to 76 \\u00b1 7 \\u03bcm thick. Such high value compared to the thickness values normally reported in the literature for pure culture electroactive bacteria justifies further investigations. Taken together, these results suggest that Glk. subterraneus performs a direct ET mechanism in contact with the electrode material. Furthermore, direct current generation from saline wastewater significantly expands the application of BESs. \",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"This work reports on the preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity of a nanocomposite formed from graphene oxide (GO) sheets decorated with silver nanoparticles (GO-Ag). The GO-Ag nanocomposite was prepared in the presence of AgNO3 and sodium citrate. The physicochemical characterization was performed by UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average size of the silver nanoparticles anchored on the GO surface was 7.5 nm. Oxidation debris fragments (a byproduct adsorbed on the GO surface) were found to be crucial for the nucleation and growth of the silver nanoparticles. The antibacterial activity of the GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite against the microorganism Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated using the standard counting plate methodology. The GO dispersion showed no antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa over the concentration range investigated. On the other hand, the GO-Ag nanocomposite displayed high biocidal activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 \\u03bcg/mL. The anti-biofilm activity toward P. aeruginosa adhered on stainless steel surfaces was also investigated. The results showed a 100% inhibition rate of the adhered cells after exposure to the GO-Ag nanocomposite for one hour. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first direct evidence that GO-Ag nanocomposites can inhibit the growth of microbial adhered cells, thus preventing the process of biofilm formation. These promising results support the idea that GO-Ag nanocomposites may be applied as antibacterial coatings material to prevent the development of biofilms in food packaging and medical devices.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"In this study, a bacterial strain, Lysinibacillus sphaericus which is relatively new in the vast list of biocatalysts known to produce electricity has been tested for its potential in power production. It is cited from the literature that the organism is deficient in some sugar or polysaccharide processing enzymes and thus is tested for its ability to utilize substrates mainly rich in protein components like beef extract and with successive production of electricity. The particular species has been found to generate a maximum power density of 85mW/m(2) and current density of \\u2248270mA/m(2) using graphite felt as electrode. The maximum Open Circuit Voltage and current has been noted as 0.7Vand 0.8mA during these operational cycles. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicate the presence of some electroactive compounds which can facilitate electron transfer from bacteria to electrode. The number of electrogens able to generate electricity in mediator free conditions are few, and the study introduces more divergence to that population. Substrate specificity and electricity generation efficacy of the strain in treating wastewater, specially rich in protein content has been reported in the study. As the species has been found to be efficient in utilizing proteinaceous material, the technique can be useful to treat specific type of wastewaters like wastewater from slaughterhouses or from meat packaging industry. Treating them in a more economical way which generates electricity as a outcome must be preferred over the conventional aerobic treatments. Emphasizing on substrate specificity, the study introduces this novel Lysinibacillus strain as a potent biocatalyst and its sustainable role in MFC application for bioenergy generation. \",\n",

Plaque samples were collected from a healthy volunteer, inoculated into growth medium and incubated with the abutments anaerobically for 1 week. A blinded, calibrated hygienist performed scaling to remove the biofilm using 6 implant scalers (in triplicate), 1 scaler for 1 abutment. The abutments were mounted on an imaging stand and processed for SEM. Images were captured in 3 randomly designated areas of interest on each abutment. Analysis of the implant polished abutment surface and plaque area measurements were performed using ImageJ image analysis software. Surface alterations were characterized by the number, length, depth and the width of the scratches observed.\\nGlass filled resin scalers resulted in significantly more and longer scratches on all 3 abutment types compared to other scalers, while unfilled resin scalers resulted in the least surface change (p < 0.05). Filled resin-graphite reinforced scalers, carbon fiber reinforced resin scalers and titanium scalers resulted in more superficial scratches compared to glass filled resin, as well as more scratches than unfilled resin. No statistically significant differences were found between scalers and abutments with regard to plaque removal.\\nThe impact of scalers on implant abutment surfaces varies between abutment types presumably due to different surface characteristics with no apparent advantage of one abutment type over the other with regard to resistance to surface damage. Unfilled resin was found consistently to be the least damaging to abutment surfaces, although all scalers of all compositions caused detectable surface changes to polished surfaces of implant abutments.\",\n",

Cell immobilization allows integration of biocatalysts in a manner that maintains long-term cell viability and typically enhances process output. A wide variety of functionalized materials have been explored for microbial cell immobilization, and specific advantages and limitations were identified. The method described here is a simple, versatile, and scalable one-step process for the chemical vapor deposition of silica to encapsulate and stabilize viable, whole bacterial cells. The immobilized bacterial population is prepared and captured at a predefined physiological state so as to affix bacteria with a selected metabolic or catalytic capability to compatible materials and surfaces.

In this study, we decorated the surface of graphene (G) with a conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), through galvanostatic electropolymerization to fabricate a G/PEDOT hybrid anode for an Escherichia coli MFC. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses illustrated that the G/PEDOT hybrid anode possesses a larger active surface area and lower charge-transfer resistance than three other kinds of anodes, namely, carbon paper (CP), graphene-modified carbon paper (CP/G), and PEDOT-modified carbon paper (CP/PEDOT). Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the bacteria growth on the four anodes. A compact biofilm was formed on the hybrid anode owing to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged bacteria and positively charged PEDOT backbone. The constant-load (1\\u2005K\\u03a9) discharge curves of MFCs with CP, CP/G, CP/PEDOT, and G/PEDOT anodes revealed that the G/PEDOT electrode had good stability and high voltage output. The G/PEDOT anode generated a maximum power density of 873\\u2005mW\\u2009m\",\n",

In order to increase bioanode performance, diverse electrode materials and modification methods have been implemented; however, the factors directly affecting performance are yet unclear. In this work carbon cloth electrodes were modified by thermal, chemical, and electrochemical oxidation to enhance oxygenated surface groups, to modify the electrode texture, and consequently the electron transfer rate and biofilm adhesion. The oxidized electrodes were physically, chemically, and electrochemically characterized, then bioanodes were formed at +0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl using domestic wastewater amended with acetate. The bioanode performance was evaluated according to the current and charge generated. The efficacy of the treatments were in the order Thermal>Electrochemical>Untreated>Chemical oxidation. The maximum current observed with untreated electrode was 0.152\\u00b10.026 mA (380\\u00b192 mA m(-2)), and it was increased by 78% and 28% with thermal and electrochemical oxidized electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the volatile solids correlated significantly with the maximum current obtained, and the electrode texture was revealed as a critical factor for increasing the bioanode performance.\",\n",

This study presents a simple method to reproducibly select Geobacter-dominated anode biofilms from a mixed inoculum of bacteria using graphite electrodes initially poised at -0.25, -0.36 and -0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The biofilms all produced maximum power density of approximately 270 m Wm(-2) (projected anode surface area). Analysis of 16S rRNA genes and intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences found that the biofilm communities were all dominated by bacteria closely related to Geobacter psychrophilus. Anodes initially poised at -0.25 V reproducibly selected biofilms that were dominated by a strain of G. psychrophilus that was genetically distinct from the strain that dominated the -0.36 and -0.42 V biofilms. This work demonstrates for the first time that closely related strains of Geobacter can have very different competitive advantages at different anode potentials.\",\n",

As expected, the stable operational voltage and the coulombic efficiency (CE) were higher for the volumetric anode than the planar anode (0.57\\u2009V and CE\\u2009=\\u200922% vs. 0.51\\u2009V and CE\\u2009=\\u200912%). The genus Geobacter was the only known exoelectrogen among the observed dominant groups, comprising 57\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094% of recovered sequences for the brush and 27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095% for the carbon-cloth anode. While the bacterial communities differed between the two anode materials, results showed that Geobacter spp. and other dominant bacterial groups were homogenously distributed across both planar and volumetric anodes.

Here, we present electrochemical analyses and biofilm 16S rRNA gene profiling of biocathodes of sediment/seawater-based MSCs inoculated from the biocathode of a previously described sediment/seawater-based MSC. Electrochemical analyses indicate that for these second-generation MSC biocathodes, catalytic activity diminishes over time if illumination is provided during growth, whereas it remains relatively stable if growth occurs in the dark. For both illuminated and dark MSC biocathodes, cyclic voltammetry reveals a catalytic-current-potential dependency consistent with heterogeneous electron transfer mediated by an insoluble microbial redox cofactor, which was conserved following enrichment of the dark MSC biocathode using a three-electrode configuration. 16S rRNA gene profiling showed Gammaproteobacteria, most closely related to Marinobacter spp., predominated in the enriched biocathode. The enriched biocathode biofilm is easily cultured on graphite cathodes, forms a multimicrobe-thick biofilm (up to 8.2 \\u03bcm), and does not lose catalytic activity after exchanges of the reactor medium. Moreover, the consortium can be grown on cathodes with only inorganic carbon provided as the carbon source, which may be exploited for proposed bioelectrochemical systems for electrosynthesis of organic carbon from carbon dioxide. These results support a scheme where two distinct communities of organisms develop within MSC biocathodes: one that is photosynthetically active and one that catalyzes reduction of O2 by the cathode, where the former partially inhibits the latter. The relationship between the two communities must be further explored to fully realize the potential for MSC applications.\",\n",

Our goals were to determine the maximum rates of anode respiration by T. ferriacetica and to perform a detailed microscopic and electrochemical characterization of the biofilm anode. T. ferriacetica DSM 14005 was grown at 60 \\u00b0C on graphite-rod anodes poised at -0.06 V (vs) SHE in duplicate microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). The cultures grew rapidly until they achieved a sustained current density of 7-8 A m(-2) with only 10 mM bicarbonate buffer and an average Coulombic Efficiency (CE) of 93%. Cyclic voltammetry performed at maximum current density revealed a Nernst-Monod response with a half saturation potential (EKA) of -0.127 V (vs) SHE. Confocal microscopy images revealed a thick layer of actively respiring cells of T. ferriacetica (~38 \\u03bcm), which is the first documentation for a gram positive anode respiring bacterium (ARB). Scanning electron microscopy showed a well-developed biofilm with a very dense network of extracellular appendages similar to Geobacter biofilms. The high current densities, a thick biofilm (~38 \\u03bcm) with multiple layers of active cells, and Nernst-Monod behavior support extracellular electron transfer (EET) through a solid conductive matrix - the first such observation for Gram-positive bacteria. Operating with a controlled anode potential enabled us to grow T. ferriacetica that can use a solid conductive matrix resulting in high current densities that are promising for MXC applications.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"It has been proposed that Geobacter sulfurreducens requires conductive pili for long-range electron transport to Fe(III) oxides and for high-density current production in microbial fuel cells. In order to investigate this further, we constructed a strain of G. sulfurreducens, designated Aro-5, which produced pili with diminished conductivity. This was accomplished by modifying the amino acid sequence of PilA, the structural pilin protein. An alanine was substituted for each of the five aromatic amino acids in the carboxyl terminus of PilA, the region in which G. sulfurreducens PilA differs most significantly from the PilAs of microorganisms incapable of long-range extracellular electron transport. Strain Aro-5 produced pili that were properly decorated with the multiheme c-type cytochrome OmcS, which is essential for Fe(III) oxide reduction. However, pili preparations of the Aro-5 strain had greatly diminished conductivity and Aro-5 cultures were severely limited in their capacity to reduce Fe(III) compared to the control strain. Current production of the Aro-5 strain, with a graphite anode serving as the electron acceptor, was less than 10% of that of the control strain. The conductivity of the Aro-5 biofilms was 10-fold lower than the control strain's. These results demonstrate that the pili of G. sulfurreducens must be conductive in order for the cells to be effective in extracellular long-range electron transport.\\nExtracellular electron transfer by Geobacter species plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of soils and sediments and has a number of bioenergy applications. For example, microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxide is one of the most geochemically significant processes in anaerobic soils, aquatic sediments, and aquifers, and Geobacter organisms are often abundant in such environments. Geobacter sulfurreducens produces the highest current densities of any known pure culture, and close relatives are often the most abundant organisms colonizing anodes in microbial fuel cells that harvest electricity from wastewater or aquatic sediments. The finding that a strain of G. sulfurreducens that produces pili with low conductivity is limited in these extracellular electron transport functions provides further insight into these environmentally significant processes.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The oxygen reduction due to microaerophilic biofilms grown on graphite cathodes (biocathodes) in Single Chamber Microbial Fuel Cells (SCMFCs) is proved and analysed in this paper. Pt-free cathode performances are compared with those of different platinum-loaded cathodes, before and after the biofilm growth. Membraneless SCMFCs were operating in batch-mode, filled with wastewater. A substrate (fuel) of sodium acetate (0.03 M) was periodically added and the experiment lasted more than six months. A maximum of power densities, up to 0.5 W m(-2), were reached when biofilms developed on the electrodes and the cathodic potential decreased (open circuit potential of 50-200 mV vs. SHE). The power output was almost constant with an acetate concentration of 0.01-0.05 M and it fell down when the pH of the media exceeded 9.5, independently of the Pt-free/Pt-loading at the cathodes. Current densities varied in the range of 1-5 Am(-2) (cathode area of 5 cm(2)). Quasi-stationary polarization curves performed with a three-electrode configuration on cathodic and anodic electrodes showed that the anodic overpotential, more than the cathodic one, may limit the current density in the SCMFCs for a long-term operation.\",\n",

We develop a method that allows the simultaneous study of bacterial biofilms by means of fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), in which transparent graphitic flakes deposited on a glass substrate are used as a support for the biofilm. The majority of the cells present on the surface were viable, and the growth of the biofilms over time showed a critical increase of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) as well as the formation of nanosized particles inside the biofilm. Also, the presence of Fe in Acidiphilium biofilms was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), whereas surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy indicated the presence of redox-active proteins.\",\n",

It is a membrane-less and mediator-free apparatus with a gilding gold mesh as an anode and a graphite carbon cloth as a cathode. The electrode spacing is 4 cm. Spirulina platensis is aggregated and deposited on the anode to form a thin biofilm. Results show that the chlorophyll (Chl) content of the biofilm attributed the PMFC's electricity performance. The open circuit voltage (OCV) reading of PMFC is proportional to Chl content when the Chl was below 0.5mg. The maximal OCV of PMFC is 0.49 V. When the PMFC was connected to an external resistance of 1 k\\u03a9, a maximum power density of 10 mW m(-2) was obtained. This designed PMFC yielded competitively high OCV and power density as compared to other microbial fuel cells reported in the literature.\",\n",

After the sedimentary microbial fuel cells were assembled the evolution of current and power vs. time was studied. Two types of commercially available graphite materials were used as electrodes, which differ mainly in shape and size. In some experiments, an external carbon source (acetate) increased the power generation rate. The maximum power density observed in the aforementioned condition was 19.57 \\u00b1 0.35 and 8.72 \\u00b1 1.39 mW/m(2) using rod and graphite disk electrodes, respectively. The better performance of the rod electrodes can be explained, at least in part, by an enhanced rate of mass transport by radial diffusion. DGGE fingerprints were used to study the electrogenic community growing over the electrodes.\",\n",

Primary, secondary and tertiary biofilms were formed by a successive scratching and re-inoculation procedure. The secondary and tertiary biofilms formed while decreasing the polarisation potential allowed the anodes to provide current density of 6A/m(2) at -0.4V/SCE. In contrast, applying -0.4V/SCE initially to form the primary biofilms did not lead to the production of current. Consequently, the scratching/re-inoculation procedure combined with progressive lowering of the applied potential revealed an efficient new procedure that gave efficient microbial anodes able to work at low potential. The observed progressive pH drift to alkaline values above 9 explained the open circuit potentials as low as -0.6 V/SCE. The remarkable performance of the electrode at alkaline pH was attributed to the presence of Desulfuromonas acetexigens as the single dominant species in the tertiary microbial anodes.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"A promising technique called chemical absorption-biological reduction (CABR) integrated approach has been developed recently for the nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) removal from flue gases. The major challenge for this approach is how to enhance the rate of the biological reduction step. To tackle the challenge, a three-dimensional biofilm-electrode reactor (3D-BER) was utilized. This reactor provides not only considerable amount of sites for biofilm, but also many electron donors for bioreduction. Factors affecting the performance of 3D-BER were optimized, including material of the third electrode (graphite), glucose concentration (1000 mg\\u00b7L(-1)), and volume current density (30.53 A\\u00b7m(-3) NCC). Experimental results clearly demonstrated that this method significantly promotes the bioreduction rate of Fe(II)EDTA-NO (0.313 mmol\\u00b7L(-1)\\u00b7h(-1)) and Fe(III)EDTA (0.564 mmol\\u00b7L(-1)\\u00b7h(-1)) simultaneously. Experiments on the mechanism showed that Fe(II)EDTA serves as the primary electron donor in the reduction of Fe(II)EDTA-NO, whereas the reduction of Fe(III)EDTA took advantage of both glucose and electrolysis-generated H(2) as electron donors. High concentration of Fe(II)EDTA-NO or Fe(III)EDTA interferes the bioreduction of the other one. The proposed methodology shows a promising prospect for NO(x) removal from flue gas.\",\n",

The prevalence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is a significant problem for the modern health care system, and application of lytic bacteriophages for controlling this pathogen may become a solution.\\nIn this study, using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microbiological assessment we have investigated A. baumannii bacteriophage AP22, which has been recently described. AFM has revealed the morphology of bacteriophage AP22, adsorbed on the surfaces of mica, graphite and host bacterial cells. Besides, morphological changes of bacteriophage AP22-infected A. baumannii cells were characterized at different stages of the lytic cycle, from phage adsorption to the cell lysis. The phage latent period, estimated from AFM was in good agreement with that obtained by microbiological methods (40 min). Bacteriophage AP22, whose head diameter is 62\\u00b11 nm and tail length is 88\\u00b19 nm, was shown to disperse A. baumannii aggregates and adsorb to the bacterial surface right from the first minute of their mutual incubation at 37\\u00b0C.\\nHigh rate of bacteriophage AP22 specific adsorption and its ability to disperse bacterial aggregates make this phage very promising for biomedical antimicrobial applications. Complementing microbiological results with AFM data, we demonstrate an effective approach, which allows not only comparing independently obtained characteristics of the lytic cycle but also visualizing the infection process.\",\n",

In this study, we present the fabrication of a nanocomposite containing poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and graphene (G) in solutions and thin films. Highly dispersed PVK-G (97-3 w/w%) solutions in various organic and aqueous solvents were prepared by solution mixing and sonication methods. The thermal properties and morphology of the new composite were analyzed using thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. PVK-G films were immobilized onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates via electrodeposition. AFM was used to characterize the resulting topography of the nanocomposite thin films, while cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis were used to monitor their successful electrodeposition. The antimicrobial properties of the electrodeposited PVK-G films and solution-based PVK-G were investigated against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). Microbial growth after exposure to the nanocomposite, metabolic assay and live-dead assay of the bacterial solutions exposed to PVK-G presented fewer viable and active bacteria than those exposed to pure PVK or pure graphene solutions. The PVK-G film inhibited about 80% of biofilm surface coverage whereas the PVK- and G-modified surfaces allowed biofilm formation over almost the whole coated surface (i.e. > 80%). The biocompatibility of the prepared PVK-G solutions on NIH 3T3 cells was evaluated using the MTS cell proliferation assay. A 24 h exposure of the PVK-G nanocomposite to the NIH 3T3 cells presented ~80% cell survival.\",\n",

We report here a new approach to build a free-standing biomimetic sensor by covalently bonding RGD-peptide on the surface of pyrenebutyric acid functionalized graphene film. The resulted graphene biofilm sensor comprises a well-packed layered nanostructure, in which the RGD-peptide component provides desired biomimetic properties for superior human cell attachment and growth on the film surface to allow real-time detection of nitric oxide, an important signal yet short-life molecule released from the attached human endothelial cells under drug stimulations. The film sensor exhibits good flexibility and stability by retaining its original response after 45 bending/relaxing cycles and high reproducibility from its almost unchanged current responses after 15 repeated measurements, while possessing high sensitivity, good selectivity against interferences often existing in biological systems, and demonstrating real time quantitative detection capability toward nitric oxide molecule released from living cells. This study not only demonstrates a facial approach to fabricate a smart nanostructured graphene-based functional biofilm, but also provides a powerful and reliable platform to the real-time study of biointeresting molecules released from living cells, thus rendering potential broad applications in neuroscience, screening drug therapy effect, and live-cell assays.\",\n",

Although antimicrobial studies of graphene-based nanomaterials are still quite limited, some researchers have paid particular attention to such nanocomposites as promising candidates for the next generation of antimicrobial agents. The polyvinyl-N-carbazole (PVK)-graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite (PVK-GO), which contains only 3 wt% of GO well-dispersed in a 97 wt% PVK matrix, presents excellent antibacterial properties without significant cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. The high polymer content in this nanocomposite makes future large-scale material manufacturing possible in a high-yield process of adiabatic bulk polymerization. In this study, the toxicity of PVK-GO was assessed with planktonic microbial cells, biofilms, and NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. The antibacterial effects were evaluated against two Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Cupriavidus metallidurans; and two Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis and Rhodococcus opacus. The results show that the PVK-GO nanocomposite presents higher antimicrobial effects than the pristine GO. The effectiveness of the PVK-GO in solution was demonstrated as the nanocomposite \\\"encapsulated\\\" the bacterial cells, which led to reduced microbial metabolic activity and cell death. The fact that the PVK-GO did not present significant cytotoxicity to fibroblast cells offers a great opportunity for potential applications in important biomedical and industrial fields.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Electron-accepting (electrotrophic) biocathodes were produced by first enriching graphite fiber brush electrodes as the anodes in sediment-type microbial fuel cells (sMFCs) using two different marine sediments and then electrically inverting the anodes to function as cathodes in two-chamber bioelectrochemical systems (BESs). Electron consumption occurred at set potentials of -439 mV and -539 mV (versus the potential of a standard hydrogen electrode) but not at -339 mV in minimal media lacking organic sources of energy. Results at these different potentials were consistent with separate linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans that indicated enhanced activity (current consumption) below only ca. -400 mV. MFC bioanodes not originally acclimated at a set potential produced electron-accepting (electrotrophic) biocathodes, but bioanodes operated at a set potential (+11 mV) did not. CO(2) was removed from cathode headspace, indicating that the electrotrophic biocathodes were autotrophic. Hydrogen gas generation, followed by loss of hydrogen gas and methane production in one sample, suggested hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. There was abundant microbial growth in the biocathode chamber, as evidenced by an increase in turbidity and the presence of microorganisms on the cathode surface. Clone library analysis of 16S rRNA genes indicated prominent sequences most similar to those of Eubacterium limosum (Butyribacterium methylotrophicum), Desulfovibrio sp. A2, Rhodococcus opacus, and Gemmata obscuriglobus. Transfer of the suspension to sterile cathodes made of graphite plates, carbon rods, or carbon brushes in new BESs resulted in enhanced current after 4 days, demonstrating growth by these microbial communities on a variety of cathode substrates. This report provides a simple and effective method for enriching autotrophic electrotrophs by the use of sMFCs without the need for set potentials, followed by the use of potentials more negative than -400 mV.\",\n",

Stable current was also produced when the batteries were operated with hay extract in salt solution. The bacterial community on the anode of the batteries was tested for air tolerance and desiccation resistance over a period ranging from 2 days to 2 weeks. The results showed that the anode community could survive complete drying of the electrolyte for several days.

However, little is known about how pH and redox potential are affected by increasing current inside biofilms respiring on electrodes. Quantifying the variations in pH and redox potential with increasing current is needed to determine how electron transfer is tied to proton transfer within the biofilm. In this research, we quantified pH and redox potential variations in electrode-respiring Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms as a function of respiration rates, measured as current. We also characterized pH and redox potential at the counter electrode. We concluded that (1) pH continued to decrease in the biofilm through different growth phases, showing that the pH is not always a limiting factor in a biofilm and (2) decreasing pH and increasing redox potential at the biofilm electrode were associated only with the biofilm, demonstrating that G. sulfurreducens biofilms respire in a unique internal environment. Redox potential inside the biofilm was also compared to the local biofilm potential measured by a graphite microelectrode, where the tip of the microelectrode was allowed to acclimatize inside the biofilm.\",\n",

The obtained microbially reduced graphene (MRG) exhibits comparable conductivity and physical characteristics to the chemically reduced graphene. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the number of exoelectrogens involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) to the solid electrode, increases due to the presence of graphene scaffolds, and the EET is facilitated in terms of electron transfer kinetics. As a result, the maximum power density of the MFC is enhanced by 32% (from 1440 to 1905 mW m(-2)) and the coulombic efficiency is improved by 80% (from 30 to 54%). The results demonstrate that the construction of the bacteria/graphene network is an effective alternative to improve the MFC performance.\",\n",

Increased anodic currents for bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of acetate were obtained when the electrodes were incubated for longer periods with periodic electron-donor feeding. The maximum current density for acetate oxidation increased 2.8-fold, and the biofilm thickness increased by 4.25-fold, over a time period of 83-147 h. Cyclic voltammetry in the presence of acetate supports a model of heterogeneous electron transfer, one electron at time, from biofilm to electrode through a dominant redox species centered at -0.41 V vs Ag/AgCl. Voltammetry performed under nonturnover conditions provided an estimate of the surface coverage of the redox species of 25 nmol/cm(2). This value was used to estimate a redox species concentration of 7.3 mM within the 34-\\u03bcm-thick biofilm and a charge-transport diffusion coefficient of 3.6 \\u00d7 10(-7) cm(2)/s. This value of diffusion coefficient is greater than that observed in traditional thin-film voltammetric studies with redox polymer films containing much higher surface concentrations of redox species and might be associated with proton transport to ensure electroneutrality within the biofilm upon electrolysis.\",\n",

Analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed that biofilms were heavily enriched in Deltaproteobacteria in comparison to control biofilms formed on non-polarized electrodes, which were preferentially composed of Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Among Deltaproteobacteria, sequences affiliated with Pelobacter and Geobacter genera were identified. A bacterial consortium was cultivated, in which 25 isolates were identified as Geobacter bremensis. Pure cultures of 4 different G. bremensis isolates gave higher current densities (1400 mA/m(2) on DSA, 2490 mA/m(2) on graphite) than the original multi-species biofilms (in average 300 mA/m(2) on DSA) and the G. bremensis DSM type strain (100-300 A/m(2) on DSA; 2485 mA/m(2) on graphite). FISH analysis confirmed that G. bremensis represented a minor fraction in the original EA biofilm, in which species related to Pelobacter genus were predominant. The Pelobacter type strain did not show EA capacity, which can explain the lower performance of the multi-species biofilms. These results stressed the great interest of extracting and culturing pure EA strains from wild EA biofilms to improve the current density provided by microbial anodes.\",\n",

Among all MFC parts, electrode materials play a crucial role in electricity generation. A variety of electrode materials have been used, including plain graphite, carbon paper and carbon cloth. However, these electrode materials generated only limited electricity or power. Recently, many research studies have been conducted on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) because of their unique physical and chemical properties that include high conductivity, high surface area, corrosion resistance, and electrochemical stability. These properties make them extremely attractive for fabricating electrodes and catalyst supports. In this study, CNT-based electrodes had been developed to improve MFC performance in terms of electricity generation and treatment efficiency. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with carboxyl groups have been employed to fabricate electrodes for single-chamber air-cathode MFCs. The quality of the prepared MWCNTs-based electrodes was evaluated by morphology, electrical conductivity and specific surface area using a field emission scanning electron microscope, four-probe method and Brunauer-Emmerr-Teller method, respectively. The performance of MFCs equipped with MWCNT-based electrodes was evaluated by chemical analysis and electrical monitoring and calculation. In addition, the performance of these MFCs, using MWCNTs as electrodes, was compared against that using commercial carbon cloth.\",\n",

The short PilA isoform is found predominantly in an intracellular fraction. It seems to stabilize the long isoform and to influence the secretion of several outer-surface c-type cytochromes. The long PilA isoform is required for secretion of PilA to the outer cell surface, a process that requires coexpression of pilA with nine downstream genes. The long isoform was determined to be essential for biofilm formation on certain surfaces, for optimum current production in microbial fuel cells, and for growth on insoluble Fe(III) oxides.\",\n",

We describe the fabrication of (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) scaffolds doped with carbon materials that provide a conductive three-dimensional architecture that was demonstrated for application in microbial fuel cell (MFC) anodes. Composite electrodes from PHBV were fabricated to defined dimensions by solvent casting and particulate leaching of a size-specific porogen (in this case, sucrose). The cellular biocompatibility of the resulting composite material facilitated effective immobilization of a defined preparation of Shewanella oneidensis DSP-10 as a model microbial catalyst. Bacterial cells were immobilized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silica to create an engineered biofilm that exhibits efficient bioelectrocatalysis of a simple-carbon fuel in a MFC. The functionalized PHBV electrodes demonstrate stable and reproducible anodic open circuit potentials of -320 \\u00b1 20 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) with lactate as the electron donor. Maximum power densities achieved by the hierarchically structured electrodes (~5 mW cm(3)) were significantly higher than previously observed for graphite-felt electrodes. The methodology for fabrication of scalable electrode materials may be amenable to other bioelectrochemical applications, such as enzyme fuel cells and biosensors, and could easily be adapted to various design concepts.\",\n",

It outperforms the planar carbon electrode because of its abilities to three-dimensionally interface with bacterial biofilm, facilitate electron transfer, and provide multiplexed and highly conductive pathways.

One promising noninvasive modality is to destroy biofilms with high-intensity focused ultrasound. In our study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown on implant-mimicking graphite disks in a flow chamber for 3 days prior to exposing them to ultrasound pulses. Exposure time at each treatment location was varied between 5, 15 and 30s. Burst period was varied between 1, 3, 6 and 12 milliseconds (ms). The pulses were 20 cycles in duration at 1.1 MHz from a spherically focused transducer (f/1, 63 mm focal length), creating peak compressional and rarefactional pressures at the graphite disk surface of 30 and 13 MPa, respectively. P. aeruginosa were tagged with green fluorescent protein, and killed cells were visualized using propidium iodide before determining the extent of biofilm destruction. The exposure-induced temperature rise was measured to be less than 0.2\\u00b0C at the focus, namely the interface between graphite disk and water. Then, the temperature rise was measured at the focus between the graphite disk and a tissue-mimicking phantom to evaluate therapy safety. Two thresholds, of bacteria destruction increase and of complete bacteria removal, respectively, were identified to divide our eight exposure conditions. Results indicated that 30-s exposure and 6-ms pulse period were sufficient to destroy the biofilms. However, the 15-s exposure and 3-ms pulse period were viewed as optimum when considering exposure time, efficacy, and safety.\",\n",

In the present study, Fe nanoparticle-modified graphite disks were used as anodes to investigate the effects of nanoparticles on the performance of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in MECs. Results demonstrated that the average current densities produced with Fe nanoparticle-decorated anodes up to 5.89-fold higher than plain graphite anodes. Whole genome microarray analysis of the gene expression showed that genes encoding biofilm formation were significantly up-regulated as a response to nanoparticle-decorated anodes. Increased expression of genes related to nanowires, flavins, and c-type cytochromes indicates that enhanced mechanisms of electron transfer to the anode may also have contributed to the observed increases in current density. The majority of the remaining differentially expressed genes associated with electron transport and anaerobic metabolism demonstrate a systemic response to increased power loads.\",\n",

The redox polymers [Os(4,4'-dimethoxy-2,2'-bipyridine)(2)(polyvinylimidazole)(10)Cl](+) and [Os(4,4'-dichloro-2,2'-bipyridine)(2)(polyvinylimidazole)(10)Cl](+) were selected to facilitate transfer of electrons from the glucose oxidase (GOx) active site to the T1 Cu site of multicopper oxygenases of Trametes hirsuta laccase (ThLacc) and Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase (MvBOD). Maximum power density at pH 5.5 of 3.5 \\u03bcW cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.35 V was obtained for an assembled membrane-less fuel cell based on ThLacc on glassy carbon as cathode, in the presence of 0.1 M glucose, 37 \\u00b0C, with lower power observed at pH 7.4 and 4.5. Replacement of the ThLacc cathode with that of MvBOD produced 10 \\u03bcW cm(-2) at 0.25 V under pseudo-physiological conditions. Replacement of glassy carbon with graphite as base electrode material resulted in increased redox polymer loading, leading to an increase in power output to 43 \\u03bcW cm(-2) at 0.25 V under similar conditions. Improved stabilization of biofilms was achieved through covalent anchoring of enzyme and redox polymer on graphite electrodes, derivatized via electrochemical reduction of the diazonium cation generated in situ from p-phenylenediamine. Enzymatic fuel cells using this approach retained 70% power at 24 h, whereas fuel cells prepared without chemical anchoring to graphite retained only 10% of power over the same interval.\",\n",

In GAC and CFC packed MFCs, Geobacter was the dominating genus, while Azospira was the most populous group in GG. Results further indicated that GAC was the most favorable for Geobacter adherence and growth, and the maximum power densities had positive correlation with the total biomass and the relative abundance of Geobacter, but without apparent correlation with the microbial diversity. Due to the low content of Geobacter in GS, power generated in this system may be attributed to other microorganisms such as Synergistes, Bacteroidetes and Castellaniella.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"There have been multiple conflicting reports about the biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of graphene oxide. To address this, we conducted a study to characterize the antimicrobial properties of graphene oxide (GO) and its biocompatibility with mammalian cells. When GO was added to a bacterial culture at 25 \\u03bcg/mL, the results showed that bacteria grew faster and to a higher optical density than cultures without GO. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that bacteria formed dense biofilms in the presence of GO. This was shown by a large mass of aggregated cells and extracellular polymeric material. Bacterial growth on filters coated with 25 and 75 \\u03bcg of GO grew 2 and 3 times better than on filters without GO. Closer analysis showed that bacteria were able to attach and proliferate preferentially in areas containing the highest GO levels. Graphene oxide films failed to produce growth inhibition zones around them, indicating a lack of antibacterial properties. Also, bacteria were able to grow on GO films to 9.5 \\u00d7 10(9) cells from an initial inoculation of 1.0 \\u00d7 10(6), indicating that it also lacks bacteriostatic activity. Thus, silver-coated GO films were able to produce clearing zones and cell death. Also, graphene oxide was shown to greatly enhance the attachment and proliferation of mammalian cells. This study conclusively demonstrates that graphene oxide does not have intrinsic antibacterial, bacteriostatic, and cytotoxic properties in both bacteria and mammalian cells. Furthermore, graphene oxide acts as a general enhancer of cellular growth by increasing cell attachment and proliferation.\",\n",

First, reduction of 4-aminophenyl diazonium is considered using increased coulombic charge density from 16.5 to 200 mC/cm(2). This procedure introduced aryl amine functionalities at the surface which are neutral at neutral pH. These electrodes were implemented as anodes in \\\"H\\\" type microbial fuel cells inoculated with waste water, acetate as the substrate and using ferricyanide reduction at the cathode and a 1000 \\u03a9 external resistance. When the microbial anode had developed, the performances of the microbial fuel cells were measured under acetate saturation conditions and compared with those of control microbial fuel cells having an unmodified graphite anode. We found that the maximum power density of microbial fuel cell first increased as a function of the extent of modification, reaching an optimum after which it decreased for higher degree of surface modification, becoming even less performing than the control microbial fuel cell. Then, the effect of the introduction of charged groups at the surface was investigated at a low degree of surface modification. It was found that negatively charged groups at the surface (carboxylate) decreased microbial fuel cell power output while the introduction of positively charged groups doubled the power output. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the microbial anode modified with positively charged groups was covered by a dense and homogeneous biofilm. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed that this biofilm consisted to a large extent of bacteria from the known electroactive Geobacter genus. In summary, the extent of modification of the anode was found to be critical for the microbial fuel cell performance. The nature of the chemical group introduced at the electrode surface was also found to significantly affect the performance of the microbial fuel cells. The method used for modification is easy to control and can be optimized and implemented for many carbon materials currently used in microbial fuel cells and other bioelectrochemical systems.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The goal of this research was to quantify the variations in redox potential and pH in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms respiring on electrodes. We grew S. oneidensis MR-1 on a graphite electrode, which was used to accept electrons for microbial respiration. We modified well-known redox and pH microelectrodes with a built-in reference electrode so that they could operate near polarized surfaces and quantified the redox potential and pH profiles in these biofilms. In addition, we used a ferri-/ferrocyanide redox system in which electrons were only transferred by mediated electron transfer to explain the observed redox potential profiles in biofilms. We found that regardless of the polarization potential of the biofilm electrode, the redox potential decreased toward the bottom of the biofilm. In a fully redox-mediated control system (ferri-/ferrocyanide redox system), the redox potential increased toward the bottom when the electrode was the electron acceptor. The opposite behavior of redox profiles in biofilms and the redox-controlled system is explained by S. oneidensis MR-1 biofilms not being redox-controlled when they respire on electrodes. The lack of a significant variation in pH implies that there is no proton transfer limitation in S. oneidensis MR-1 biofilms and that redox potential profiles are not caused by pH.\",\n",

In order to further investigate the role of OmcZ in current production, its location was investigated with immunogold labelling. OmcZ was dispersed throughout the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells that accumulated at the bottom of the culture tubes of cells grown under standard conditions with fumarate as the electron acceptor. When G. sulfurreducens grew as a biofilm on a graphite electrode that served as an anode and the sole electron acceptor for growth, OmcZ was highly concentrated at the biofilm-electrode interface. Controls in which the biofilm was grown on the same graphite material, but with fumarate as the electron acceptor, did not have accumulations of OmcZ at the anode, corresponding with the reduced capacity for current production in fumarate-grown biofilms. The specific localization of OmcZ at the anode surface under current-producing conditions, coupled with the previously published finding that deleting the gene for OmcZ dramatically increases the resistance of electron exchange between the anode and the biofilm, suggests that OmcZ may serve as an electrochemical gate facilitating electron transfer from G. sulfurreducens biofilms to the anode surface.\",\n",

The MES cannot provide current but it is optimized for wastewater treatment. An electrochemically active biofilm (EAB) was grown on graphite felt under constant polarization in an urban wastewater. Controlling the electrode potential and inoculating the bioreactor with a suspension of an established EAB improved the performance and the reproducibility of the anodes. Anodes, colonized by an EAB were tested for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from urban wastewater using a variety of bio-electrochemical processes (microbial electrolysis, MFC, MES). The MES technology, as well as a short-circuited MFC, led to a COD removal 57% higher than a 1000 \\u03a9-connected MFC, confirming the potential for wastewater treatment.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Bioelectrochemical systems rely on microorganisms to link complex oxidation/reduction reactions to electrodes. For example, in Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1, an electron transfer conduit consisting of cytochromes and structural proteins, known as the Mtr respiratory pathway, catalyzes electron flow from cytoplasmic oxidative reactions to electrodes. Reversing this electron flow to drive microbial reductive metabolism offers a possible route for electrosynthesis of high value fuels and chemicals. We examined electron flow from electrodes into Shewanella to determine the feasibility of this process, the molecular components of reductive electron flow, and what driving forces were required. Addition of fumarate to a film of S. oneidensis adhering to a graphite electrode poised at -0.36 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) immediately led to electron uptake, while a mutant lacking the periplasmic fumarate reductase FccA was unable to utilize electrodes for fumarate reduction. Deletion of the gene encoding the outer membrane cytochrome-anchoring protein MtrB eliminated 88% of fumarate reduction. A mutant lacking the periplasmic cytochrome MtrA demonstrated more severe defects. Surprisingly, disruption of menC, which prevents menaquinone biosynthesis, eliminated 85% of electron flux. Deletion of the gene encoding the quinone-linked cytochrome CymA had a similar negative effect, which showed that electrons primarily flowed from outer membrane cytochromes into the quinone pool, and back to periplasmic FccA. Soluble redox mediators only partially restored electron transfer in mutants, suggesting that soluble shuttles could not replace periplasmic protein-protein interactions. This work demonstrates that the Mtr pathway can power reductive reactions, shows this conduit is functionally reversible, and provides new evidence for distinct CymA:MtrA and CymA:FccA respiratory units.\",\n",

This work studies autotrophic nitrite removal in the cathode of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Special attention was paid to determining whether nitrite is used as the electron acceptor by exoelectrogenic bacteria (biologic reaction) or by graphite electrodes (abiotic reaction). The results demonstrated that, after a nitrate pulse at the cathode, nitrite was initially accumulated; subsequently, nitrite was removed. Nitrite and nitrate can be used interchangeably as an electron acceptor by exoelectrogenic bacteria for nitrogen reduction from wastewater while producing bioelectricity. However, if oxygen is present in the cathode chamber, nitrite is oxidised via biological or electrochemical processes. The identification of a dominant bacterial member similar to Oligotropha carboxidovorans confirms that autotrophic denitrification is the main metabolism mechanism in the cathode of an MFC.\",\n",

Replacement of GSU1501 with a kanamycin resistance cassette produced a similarly defective mutant, which could be partially complemented by expression of GSU1500 to GSU1505 in trans. The \\u03941501 mutant demonstrated limited cell-cell agglutination, enhanced attachment to negatively charged surfaces, and poor attachment to positively charged poly-d-lysine- or Fe(III)-coated surfaces. Wild-type and mutant cells attached to graphite electrodes, but when electrodes were poised at an oxidizing potential inducing a positive surface charge (+0.24 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]), \\u03941501 mutant cells detached. Scanning electron microscopy revealed fibrils surrounding wild-type G. sulfurreducens which were absent from the \\u03941501 mutant. Similar amounts of type IV pili and pilus-associated cytochromes were detected on both cell types, but shearing released a stable matrix of c-type cytochromes and other proteins bound to polysaccharides. The matrix from the mutant contained 60% less sugar and was nearly devoid of c-type cytochromes such as OmcZ. The addition of wild-type extracellular matrix to \\u03941501 cultures restored agglutination and Fe(III) reduction. The polysaccharide binding dye Congo red preferentially bound wild-type cells and extracellular matrix material over mutant cells, and Congo red inhibited agglutination and Fe(III) reduction by wild-type cells. These results demonstrate a crucial role for the xap (extracellular anchoring polysaccharide) locus in metal oxide attachment, cell-cell agglutination, and localization of essential cytochromes beyond the Geobacter outer membrane.\",\n",

Electrons appearing in these products accounted for over 85% of the electrons consumed.

Microarray analysis was used to compare gene transcript abundance in biofilms of G. sulfurreducens using a graphite electrode as the sole electron donor for fumarate reduction compared with transcript abundance in biofilms growing on the same material, but not consuming current. Surprisingly, genes for putative cell-electrode connections, such as outer-surface cytochromes and pili, which are highly expressed in current-producing biofilms, were not highly expressed in current-consuming biofilms. Microarray analysis of G. sulfurreducens gene transcript abundance in current-consuming biofilms versus current-producing biofilms gave similar results. In both comparative studies current-consuming biofilms had greater transcript abundance for a gene (GSU3274) encoding a putative monoheme, c-type cytochrome. Deletion of genes for outer-surface proteins previously shown to be essential for optimal electron transfer to electrodes had no impact on electron transfer from electrodes. Deletion of GSU3274 completely inhibited electron transfer from electrodes, but had no impact on electron transfer to electrodes. These differences in gene expression patterns and the impact of gene deletions suggest that the mechanisms for electron transfer from electrodes to G. sulfurreducens differ significantly from the mechanisms for electron transfer to electrodes.\",\n",

Based on their genomic analysis, seven bacterial isolates were selected and a cyclic voltammetry (CV) procedure was implemented to check their electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction. All isolates exhibited close catalytic characteristics. Comparison between CVs recorded with glassy carbon and pyrolytic graphite electrodes showed that the catalytic effect was not correlated with the surface area covered by the cells. The low catalytic effect obtained with filtered isolates indicated the involvement of released redox compounds, which was confirmed by CVs performed with adsorbed iron-porphyrin. None of the isolates were able to form electro-active biofilms under constant polarization. The capacity to catalyze oxygen reduction is shown to be a widespread property among bacteria, but the property detected by CV does not necessarily confer the ability to achieve stable oxygen reduction under constant polarization.\",\n",

The feed was brewery wastewater diluted in domestic wastewater. Biofilms were grown at open circuit or under an external load. Microbial diversity was analysed as a function of current and anode material. The bacterial community formed at open circuit was influenced by the anode material. However at closed circuit its role in determining the bacterial consortia formed was less important than the passage of current. The rate and extent of organic matter removal were similar for all materials: over 95% under closed circuit. The biofilm in MFCs working at open circuit and in the control reactors, increased COD removal by up to a factor of nine compared with that for baseline reactors. The average voltage output was 0.6 V at closed circuit, with an external resistor of 300 kOmega and 0.75 V at open circuit for all materials except RVC. The poor performance of this material might be related to the surface area available and concentration polarizations caused by the morphology of the material and the structure of the biofilm. Peak power varied from 1.3 mW m(-2) for RVC to 568 mW m(-2) for graphite with biofilm grown at closed circuit.\",\n",

On graphite and polycrystalline carbon rods, the catalytic current of about 500 microA cm(-2) (projected surface area) at 30 degrees C was achieved. Carbon fiber veil or carbon-paper based materials, having a large microbially-accessible surface gave a projected current density approximately 40% higher than on graphite rod. In contrast, the biofilm cannot form well on graphite foil. Elevating the temperature from 30 to 40 degrees C increased current density by 80% on graphite rod anodes. Interestingly, the formal potential of the active site (-0.12 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE))) is similar to all electrocatalytically active microbial biofilms and to that found for Geobacter sulfurreducens in previous studies. In addition, the real surface area values measured by BET surface area technique cannot provide a reasonable explanation for suitability of an electrode material for the formation of electrochemically active biofilm.\",\n",

A bioreactor equipped with an air cathode and graphite-felt anode was inoculated with a green hot-spring microbial mat. When the reactor was irradiated with light, electric current was generated between the anode and cathode in accordance with the formation of green biofilm on the anode. Fluorescence microscopy of the green biofilm revealed the presence of chlorophyll-containing microbes of approximately 10 microm in size, and these cells were abundant close to the surface of the biofilm. The biofilm community was also analyzed by sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified small-subunit rRNA gene fragments, showing that sequence types affiliated with Chlorophyta, Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were abundantly detected. These results suggest that green algae and heterotrophic bacteria cooperatively converted light energy into electricity.\",\n",

The selection of ARB should depend on the anode potential, which determines the amount of energy available for bacterial growth and maintenance. In our study, we investigated how anode potential affected the microbial diversity of the biofilm community. We used a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) containing four graphite electrodes, each at a different anode potential (E(anode) = -0.15, -0.09, +0.02, and +0.37 V vs SHE). We used wastewater-activated sludge as inoculum, acetate as substrate, and continuous-flow operation. The two electrodes at the lowest potentials showed a faster biofilm growth and produced the highest current densities, reaching up to 10.3 A/m(2) at the saturation of an amperometric curve; the electrode at the highest potential produced a maximum of 0.6 A/m(2). At low anode potentials, clone libraries showed a strong selection (92-99% of total clones) of an ARB that is 97% similar to G. sulfurreducens. At the highest anode potential, the ARB community was diverse. Cyclic voltammograms performed on each electrode suggest that the ARB grown at the lowest potentials carried out extracellular electron transport exclusively by conducting electrons through the extracellular biofilm matrix. This is supported by scanning electron micrographs showing putative bacterial nanowires and copious EPS at the lowest potentials. Non-ARB and ARB using electron shuttles in the diverse community for the highest anode potential may have insulated the ARB using a solid conductive matrix from the anode. Continuous-flow operation and the selective pressure due to low anode potentials selected for G. sulfurreducens, which are known to consume acetate efficiently and use a solid conductive matrix for electron transport.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Poor cathodic oxygen reduction and the detrimental buildup of a pH gradient between anode and cathode are the major hurdles in the development of sustainable microbial fuel cells (MFCs). This article describes and tests a concept that can help overcoming both of these limitations, by inverting the polarity of the MFC repeatedly, allowing anodic and cathodic reactions to occur alternately in the same half-cell and hence neutralizing its respective pH effects. For simplicity, we studied polarity inversion exclusively in one half-cell, maintaining its potential at -300 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) by a potentiostat. An alternating supply of acetate and dissolved oxygen to the biofilm resulted in the tested half-cell repeatedly changing from an anode to a cathode and vice versa. This repeated inversion of current direction avoided the detrimental drifting of the electrolyte pH. Control runs without current inversion ceased to produce current, as a result of anode acidification. The presence of the anodophilic biofilm survived the intermittent oxygen exposure and could measurably facilitate the cathodic reaction by reducing the apparent oxygen overpotential. It enabled cathodic oxygen reduction at about -150 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) compared to -300 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) for the same electrode material (granular graphite) without biofilm. Provided that a suitable cathodic potential was chosen, the presence of \\\"anodophilic bacteria\\\" at the cathode could enable a 5-fold increase in power output. Overall, the ability of an electrochemically active biofilm to catalyze both substrate oxidation and cathodic oxygen reduction in a single bioelectrochemical system has been documented. This property could be useful to alleviate both the cathodic oxygen reduction and the detrimental drifting of electrolyte pH in an MFC system. Further research is warranted to explore the application of such bidirectional microbial catalytic properties for sustainable MFC processes.\",\n",

Borehole graphite anodes were installed downgradient from a region of acetate injection designed to stimulate bioreduction of U(VI); cathodes consisted of graphite electrodes embedded at the ground surface. Significant increases in current density (< or =50 mA/m2) tracked delivery of acetate to the electrodes, dropping rapidly when acetate inputs were discontinued. An upgradient control electrode not exposed to acetate produced low, steady currents (< or =0.2 mA/m2). Elevated current was strongly correlated with uranium removal but minimal correlation existed with elevated Fe(II). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of electrodes revealed firmly attached biofilms, and analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated the electrode surfaces were dominated (67-80%) by Geobacter species. This is the first demonstration that electrodes can produce readily detectable currents despite long-range (6 m) separation of anode and cathode, and these results suggest that oxidation of acetate coupled to electron transfer to electrodes by Geobacter species was the primary source of current. Thus it is expected that current production may serve as an effective proxy for monitoring in situ microbial activity in a variety of subsurface anoxic environments.\",\n",

Many anaerobic bacteria, which can transfer electrons to solid electrodes, had been identified. However, little attention has been paid to the interactions between aerobic biofilms and electrodes. In this study, marine biofilms formation on graphite electrodes was characterized by open circuit potential and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Electron transfer between marine aerobic biofilms and graphite electrodes was investigated primarily by cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. Herein, we suggest that marine biofilms are a kind of conductive biofilms that can transfer electrons to graphite electrodes under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Some cytochrome species in bacterial biofilms may play a key role in the electron transfer process.\",\n",

With stainless steel mesh cathode and KMnO(4) as cathodic electrolyte the power production and CE of 70.48 W/m(3) and 64.5%, respectively, was obtained. The performance of this earthen pot MFC was evaluated with biotic and abiotic cathode. Although, biofilm formation on the cathode is observed to be helpful in enhancing power out put, the thicker biofilm on the cathode showed reduction in power. This MFC demonstrated competitive performance as compared to MFC incorporated with membrane. This low cost MFC, with total production cost of less than 1.0$, as per Indian market, demonstrated its utility as a wastewater treatment and onsite power generation device.\",\n",

Although purified outer membrane cytochromes will reduce both electrodes and metals, S. oneidensis also secretes flavins, which accelerate electron transfer to metals and electrodes. We developed techniques for detecting direct electron transfer by intact cells, using turnover and single turnover voltammetry. Metabolically active cells attached to graphite electrodes produced thin (submonolayer) films that demonstrated both catalytic and reversible electron transfer in the presence and absence of flavins. In the absence of soluble flavins, electron transfer occurred in a broad potential window centered at approximately 0 V (versus standard hydrogen electrode), and was altered in single (DeltaomcA, DeltamtrC) and double deletion (DeltaomcA/DeltamtrC) mutants of outer membrane cytochromes. The addition of soluble flavins at physiological concentrations significantly accelerated electron transfer and allowed catalytic electron transfer to occur at lower applied potentials (-0.2 V). Scan rate analysis indicated that rate constants for direct electron transfer were slower than those reported for pure cytochromes (approximately 1 s(-1)). These observations indicated that anodic current in the higher (>0 V) window is due to activation of a direct transfer mechanism, whereas electron transfer at lower potentials is enabled by flavins. The electrochemical dissection of these activities in living cells into two systems with characteristic midpoint potentials and kinetic behaviors explains prior observations and demonstrates the complementary nature of S. oneidensis electron transfer strategies.\",\n",

However, the coulombic efficiency is limited by the fact that only suspended cells are used as biocatalyst in anodic medium. MFCs using Fe (III)-reducing bacteria have high energy recovery efficiency, but can only utilize some simple organic matters. In this study, Enterobacter aerogenes XM02, a hydrogen-producing strain with Fe(III)-reducing activity, was selected as biocatalyst for MFCs, which could produce electricity by digesting lots of carbohydrates even starch. Graphite felt, a material with high specific surface area and hydrogen catalysis, instead of carbon paper supported platinum, was used as anode material. The coulombic efficiency had been substantially improved from 1.68% to 42.49%, higher than other HPB-based MFCs previously reported. The SEM image proved the ability of XM02 strain to colonize on the anode surface. Power generation of MFCs could restore quickly when anodic medium was completely replaced with non-growth medium containing glucose. This suggested that the attached cells contributed to electricity production because planktonic cells had been removed during the medium replacement. This study proposed the mechanism of power generated from in situ oxidation of hydrogen produced by the XM02 strain biofilm.\",\n",

The reactors were inoculated with three different microbial samples that were drawn from exactly the same place in a French Atlantic coastal port (i) by scraping the biofilm that had formed naturally on the surface of a floating bridge, (ii) by taking marine sediments just under the floating bridge, and (iii) by taking nearby beach sand. Current densities of 2.0 A/m2 were reached using the biofilm sample as inoculum while only 0.4 A/m2 and 0.8 A/m2 were obtained using the underlying sediments and the beach sand, respectively. The structure of bacterial communities forming biofilms was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, and revealed differences between samples with the increase in relative intensities of some bands and the appearance of others. Bacteria close related to Bacteroidetes, Halomonas, and Marinobacterium were retrieved only from the efficient EA-biofilms formed from natural biofilms, whereas, bacteria close related to Mesoflavibacter were predominant on biofilm formed from sediments. The marine biofilm was selected as the inoculum to further optimize the microbial anode. Epifluorescence microscopy and SEM confirmed that maintaining the electrode under constant polarization promoted rapid settlement of the electrode surface by a bacterial monolayer film. The microbial anode was progressively adapted to the consumption of acetate by three serial additions of substrate, thus improving the Coulombic efficiency of acetate consumption from 31 to 89%. The possible oxidation of sulfide played only a very small part in the current production and the biofilm was not able to oxidize hydrogen. Graphite proved to be more efficient than dimensionally stable anode (DSA) or stainless steel butthis result might be due to differences in the surface roughness rather than the intrinsic features of the materials. Finally, a maximal current density of 7.9 A/m2 was reached with 10 mM acetate after only 8 days of biofilm formation at -0.1 V/SCE. These results are among the best performance values reported in the literature. Using natural biofilms as inoculum should, consequently, be a new, very promising wayto rapidly build more efficient microbial electrodes than those produced when the inoculum is drawn from bulk environments.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"This study demonstrates, for the first time, the proof-of-principle of an MEC in which both the anodic and cathodic reaction are catalyzed by microorganisms. No expensive chemical catalysts, such as platinum, are needed. Two of these MECs were simultaneously operated and reached a maximum of 1.4 A/m(2) at an applied cell voltage of 0.5 V. At a cathode potential of -0.7 V, the biocathode in the MECs had a higher current density (MEC 1: 1.9 A/m(2), MEC 2: 3.3 A/m(2)) than a control cathode (0.3 A/m(2), graphite felt without biofilm) in an electrochemical half cell. This indicates that hydrogen production is catalyzed at the biocathode, likely by electrochemically active microorganisms. The cathodic hydrogen recovery was 17% for MEC 1 and 21% for MEC 2. Hydrogen losses were ascribed to diffusion through membrane and tubing, and methane formation. After 1600 h of operation, the current density of the MECs had decreased to 0.6 A/m(2), probably caused by precipitation of calcium phosphate on the biocathode. The slow deteriorating effect of calcium phosphate, and the production of methane show the importance of studying the combination of bioanode and biocathode in one electrochemical cell, and of studying long term performance of such an MEC.\",\n",

The possibility of adapting this organism to produce even higher current densities was evaluated. A system in which a graphite anode was poised at -400 mV (versus Ag/AgCl) was inoculated with the wild-type strain of G. sulfurreducens, strain DL-1. An isolate, designated strain KN400, was recovered from the biofilm after 5 months of growth on the electrode. KN400 was much more effective in current production than strain DL-1. This was apparent with anodes poised at -400 mV, as well as in systems run in true fuel cell mode. KN400 had current (7.6A/m(2)) and power (3.9 W/m(2)) densities that respectively were substantially higher than those of DL1 (1.4A/m(2) and 0.5 W/m(2)). On a per cell basis KN400 was more effective in current production than DL1, requiring thinner biofilms to make equivalent current. The enhanced capacity for current production in KN400 was associated with a greater abundance of electrically conductive microbial nanowires than DL1 and lower internal resistance (0.015 versus 0.130 Omega/m(2)) and mass transfer limitation in KN400 fuel cells. KN400 produced flagella, whereas DL1 does not. Surprisingly, KN400 had much less outer-surface c-type cytochromes than DL1. KN400 also had a greater propensity to form biofilms on glass or graphite than DL1, even when growing with the soluble electron acceptor, fumarate. These results demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the ability of microorganisms to electrochemically interact with electrodes with the appropriate selective pressure and that improved current production is associated with clear differences in the properties of the outer surface of the cell that may provide insights into the mechanisms for microbe-electrode interactions.\",\n",

In addition, two electron microscopy techniques (TEM and SEM) were employed to determine the degree of attachment and the growth of the biofilm overtime on two solid supports: carbon fibre cloth and graphite rods. The main constituents of the EPS extracted by all methods were proteins and carbohydrates, as confirmed by FT-IR analysis, showing the major presence of carboxylic, hydroxylic and amino groups. The greater extractions of EPS were obtained using EDTA. This method also produced a less degree of cellular lysis.

Biofilms of Geobacter sulfurreducens were grown either in flow-through systems with graphite anodes as the electron acceptor or on the same graphite surface, but with fumarate as the sole electron acceptor. Fumarate-grown biofilms were not immediately capable of significant current production, suggesting substantial physiological differences from current-producing biofilms. Microarray analysis revealed 13 genes in current-harvesting biofilms that had significantly higher transcript levels. The greatest increases were for pilA, the gene immediately downstream of pilA, and the genes for two outer c-type membrane cytochromes, OmcB and OmcZ. Down-regulated genes included the genes for the outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, OmcS and OmcT. Results of quantitative RT-PCR of gene transcript levels during biofilm growth were consistent with microarray results. OmcZ and the outer-surface c-type cytochrome, OmcE, were more abundant and OmcS was less abundant in current-harvesting cells. Strains in which pilA, the gene immediately downstream from pilA, omcB, omcS, omcE, or omcZ was deleted demonstrated that only deletion of pilA or omcZ severely inhibited current production and biofilm formation in current-harvesting mode. In contrast, these gene deletions had no impact on biofilm formation on graphite surfaces when fumarate served as the electron acceptor. These results suggest that biofilms grown harvesting current are specifically poised for electron transfer to electrodes and that, in addition to pili, OmcZ is a key component in electron transfer through differentiated G. sulfurreducens biofilms to electrodes.\",\n",

Despite the fluctuations observed, aerobic metabolic function (379 mV; 538 mA/m2) documented higher power generation compared to anoxic (251 mV; 348 mA/m2) and anaerobic (265 mV; 211 mA/m2) operations. Relatively higher treatment efficiency was also evidenced in aerobic operation (COD removal efficiency; 77.68% (aerobic), 56.84% (anoxic), 48.68% (anaerobic)). Polarization behavior, bioelectrochemical analysis, sustainable resistance and cell potentials also supported the aerobic operation. Aerobic metabolic function showed potential to generate higher power and substrate degradation over the corresponding anoxic and anaerobic metabolic functions. The relative efficiency of power generation observed in aerobic microenvironment might be attributed to effective substrate oxidation and good biofilm growth observed on the anodic surface. Presence of lower dissolved oxygen concentration in anodic chamber due to the establishment of equilibrium between substrate oxidation and oxygen scavenging might also contributes positively to power generation in aerobic operation.\",\n",

This work studied the pathway of glucose conversion in continuous microbial fuel cell anodes with an adapted bacterial community. The study revealed that the majority of glucose is first fermented to hydrogen and acetate. Both are then used as substrates for bacterial electricity generation. When methanogens are present methane production occurs at a rate that slightly increases with the current. Methanogenesis and electricity generation compete for hydrogen, causing increased fermentation rates. In a rather young anodic biofilm on granular graphite, methanogenesis can be suppressed by aerating the anode compartment for one hour. Only short-term inhibition can be achieved applying the same technique on a well established biofilm on granular graphite. This study shows that fermentative processes are not detrimental to current generation, and that direct oxidation of glucose does not play a major role in mixed population conversions in a MFC anode.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The goal of this study was to quantify the relation between the surface area of the current-limiting electrode of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) and the power density generated by the MFC. Shewanella oneidensis (MR-1) was grown anaerobically in the anodic compartment of an MFC utilizing lactate as the electron donor. Graphite plate electrodes of various sizes were used as anodes. Commercially available air electrodes, composed of manganese-based catalyzed carbon bonded to a current-collecting screen made of platinum mesh, were used as cathodes, and dissolved oxygen was used as the cathodic reactant. The surface area of the cathode was always significantly larger than that of the anode, to ensure that the anode was the current-limiting electrode. The power density generated by the MFC decreased as the surface area of the anode increased, which fits well with the trend we detected comparing various published results. Thus, our findings bring into question the assertion that the overall power density generated by an MFC with large electrodes can be estimated by extrapolating from an electrode with a small surface area. Our results indicate that the maximum power density generated by an MFC is not directly proportional to the surface area of the anode, but is instead proportional to the logarithm of the surface area of the anode.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) are able to transfer electrons from reduced substrates to a solid electrode. Previously, we developed a biofilm model based on the Nernst-Monod equation to describe the anode potential losses of ARB that transfer electrons through a solid conductive matrix. In this work, we develop an experimental setup to demonstrate how well the Nernst-Monod equation is able to represent anode potential losses in an ARB biofilm. We performed low-scan cyclic voltammetry (LSCV) throughout the growth phase of an ARB biofilm on a graphite electrode growing on acetate in continuous mode. The (j)V response of 9 LSCVs corresponded well to the Nernst-Monod equation, and the half-saturation potential (E(KA)) was -0.425 +/- 0.002 V vs Ag/AgCl at 30 degrees C (-0.155 +/- 0.002 V vs SHE). Anode-potential losses from the potential of acetate reached approximately 0.225 V at current density saturation, and this loss was determined by our microbial community's E(KA) value. The LSCVs at high current densities showed no significant deviation from the Nernst-Monod ideal shape, indicating that the conductivity of the biofilm matrix (kappa(bio)) was high enough (> or = 0.5 mS/cm) that potential loss did not affect the performance of the biofilm anode. Our results confirm the applicability of the Nernst-Monod equation for a conductive biofilm anode and give insights of the processes that dominate anode potential losses in microbial fuel cells.\",\n",

To identify their ecological roles, the present study isolated a corresponding bacterium (strain Mfc52) by direct plating of a biofilm suspension onto a solid medium containing glucose and ferric ion. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this strain is deeply branched in the class Alphaproteobacteria and may represent a novel order. Strain Mfc52 fermented sugars and produced lactate, acetate, and fumarate, whereas ferric ion stimulated the growth on glucose. When an MFC was inoculated with this strain and supplemented with glucose, it fermented glucose and generated electricity by oxidizing organic acids produced from glucose. Electron micrographs showed that a fraction of cells in a liquid culture had prosthecae-like appendages that were abundantly observed in anode biofilm. These observations suggest that the bacterial population represented by strain Mfc52 shared an important niche in the cellulose-fed MFC, where it generated electricity by oxidizing intermediate metabolites from cellulose degradation.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The possibility that graphite electrodes can serve as the direct electron donor for microbially catalyzed reductive dechlorination was investigated with Geobacter lovleyi. In an initial evaluation of whether G. lovleyi could interact electronically with graphite electrodes, cells were provided with acetate as the electron donor and an electrode as the sole electron acceptor. Current was produced at levels that were ca. 10-fold lower than those previously reported for Geobacter sulfurreducens under similar conditions, and G. lovleyi anode biofilms were correspondingly thinner. When an electrode poised at -300 mV (versus a standard hydrogen electrode) was provided as the electron donor, G. lovleyi effectively reduced fumarate to succinate. The stoichiometry of electrons consumed to succinate produced was 2:1, the ratio expected if the electrode served as the sole electron donor for fumarate reduction. G. lovleyi effectively reduced tetrachloroethene (PCE) to cis-dichloroethene with a poised electrode as the sole electron donor at rates comparable to those obtained when acetate serves as the electron donor. Cells were less abundant on the electrodes when the electrodes served as an electron donor than when they served as an electron acceptor. PCE was not reduced in controls without cells or when the current supply to cells was interrupted. These results demonstrate that G. lovleyi can use a poised electrode as a direct electron donor for reductive dechlorination of PCE. The ability to colocalize dechlorinating microorganisms with electrodes has several potential advantages for bioremediation of subsurface chlorinated contaminants, especially in source zones where electron donor delivery is challenging and often limits dechlorination.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"It has been previously noted that mixed communities typically produce more power in microbial fuel cells than pure cultures. If true, this has important implications for the design of microbial fuel cells and for studying the process of electron transfer on anode biofilms. To further evaluate this, Geobacter sulfurreducens was grown with acetate as fuel in a continuous flow 'ministack' system in which the carbon cloth anode and cathode were positioned in close proximity, and the cation-selective membrane surface area was maximized in order to overcome some of the electrochemical limitations that were inherent in fuel cells previously employed for the study of pure cultures. Reducing the size of the anode in order to eliminate cathode limitation resulted in maximum current and power densities per m(2) of anode surface of 4.56 A m(-2) and 1.88 W m(-2) respectively. Electron recovery as current from acetate oxidation was c. 100% when oxygen diffusion into the system was minimized. This performance is comparable to the highest levels previously reported for mixed communities in similar microbial fuel cells and slightly higher than the power output of an anaerobic sludge inoculum in the same ministack system. Minimizing the volume of the anode chamber yielded a volumetric power density of 2.15 kW m(-3), which is the highest power density per volume yet reported for a microbial fuel cell. Geobacter sulfurreducens formed relatively uniform biofilms 3-18 mum thick on the carbon cloth anodes. When graphite sticks served as the anode, the current density (3.10 A m(-2)) was somewhat less than with the carbon cloth anodes, but the biofilms were thicker (c. 50 mum) with a more complex pillar and channel structure. These results suggest that the previously observed disparity in power production in pure and mixed culture microbial fuel cell systems can be attributed more to differences in the fuel cell designs than to any inherent superior capability of mixed cultures to produce more power than pure cultures.\",\n",

A graphite anode and a stainless steel cathode which have been proven, separately, to be efficient in MFC were investigated. A closed anodic compartment was inoculated with sediments, filled with deoxygenated seawater and fed with milk to recover the sediment's sulphide concentration. A stainless steel cathode, immersed in aerated seawater, used the marine biofilm formed on its surface to catalyze oxygen reduction. The cell implemented with a 0.02m(2)-graphite anode supplied around 0.10W/m(2) for 45 days. A power of 0.02W/m(2) was obtained after the anode replacement by a 0.06m(2)-stainless steel electrode. The cell lost its capacity to make a motor turn after one day of operation, but recovered its full efficiency after a few days in open circuit. The evolution of the kinetic properties of stainless steel was identified as responsible for the power limitation.\",\n",

An acetate-fed, pH-controlled MFC was operated for over 200 days to establish a highly active MFC anodic biofilm using ferricyanide as the catholyte and granular graphite as electrode material. From the Coulombic efficiency of 83% of the MFC the microbial activity could be recorded by online monitoring of the current. Our results suggest that (1) in analogy to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics a half-saturation anodic potential (here termed k(AP) value) could be established at which the microbial metabolic rate reached half its maximum rate. This k(AP) value was about -455 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) for our acetate-driven MFC and independent of the oxidation capacity of the cathodic half-cell; (2) a critical AP (here termed AP(crit)) of about -420 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) was established that characterizes the bacterial saturation by the electron-accepting system. This critical potential appeared to characterize the maximum power output of the MFC. This information would be useful for modeling and optimization of microbial fuel cells and the relative comparison of different microbial consortia at the anode.\",\n",

Three MFCs (plain graphite electrodes, air cathode, Nafion membrane) were operated separately with variable biofilm coverage [control; anode surface coverage (ASC), 0%], partially developed biofilm [PDB; ASC approximately 44%; 90 days] and fully developed biofilm [FDB; ASC approximately 96%; 180 days] under acidophilic conditions (pH 6) at room temperature. The study depicted the effectiveness of anodic biofilm formation in enhancing the extracellular electron transfer in the absence of mediators. Higher specific power production [29 mW/kg COD(R) (CW and DSW)], specific energy yield [100.46 J/kg VSS (CW)], specific power yield [0.245 W/kg VSS (DSW); 0.282 W/kg VSS (CW)] and substrate removal efficiency of 66.07% (substrate degradation rate, 0.903 kgCOD/m(3)-day) along with effective functioning fuel cell at relatively higher resistance [4.5 komega (DSW); 14.9 komega (CW)] correspond to sustainable power [0.008 mW (DSW); 0.021 mW (CW)] and effective electron discharge (at higher resistance) and recovery (Coulomb efficiency; 27.03%) were observed especially with FDB operation. Cyclic voltammetry analysis documented six-fold increment in energy output from control (1.812 mJ) to PDB (10.666 mJ) operations and about eight-fold increment in energy from PDB to FDB (86.856 mJ). Biofilm configured MFC was shown to have the potential to selectively support the growth of electrogenic bacteria with robust characteristics, capable of generating higher power yields along with substrate degradation especially operated with characteristically complex wastewaters as substrates.\",\n",

However, previous studies have suggested that microorganisms that readily transfer electrons to graphite do not transfer electrons to gold. Investigations with Geobacter sulfurreducens demonstrated that it could grow on gold anodes producing current nearly as effectively as with graphite anodes. Current production was associated with the development of G. sulfurreducens biofilms up to 40 microm thick. No current was produced if pilA, the gene for the structural protein of the conductive pili of G. sulfurreducens, was deleted. The finding that gold is a suitable anode material for microbial fuel cells offers expanded possibilities for the construction of microbial fuel cells and the electrochemical analysis of microbe-electrode interactions.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The search for microorganisms that are capable of catalyzing the reduction of an electrode within a fuel cell has primarily been focused on bacteria that operate mesobiotically. Bacteria that function optimally under extreme conditions are beginning to be examined because they may serve as more effective catalysts (higher activity, greater stability, longer life, capable of utilizing a broader range of fuels) in microbial fuel cells. An examination of marine sediment from temperate waters (Charleston, SC) proved to be a good source of thermophilic electrode-reducing bacteria. Electric current normalized to the surface area of graphite electrodes was approximately ten times greater when sediment fuel cells were incubated at 60 degrees C (209 to 254 mA/m(2)) vs 22 degrees C (10 to 22 mA/m(2)). Electricity-generating communities were selected in sediment fuel cells and then maintained without sediment or synthetic electron-carrying mediators in single-chambered fuel cells. Current was generated when cellulose or acetate was added as a substrate to the cells. The 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes from the heavy biofilms that formed on the graphite anodes of acetate-fed fuel cells were cloned and sequenced. The preponderance of the clones (54 of 80) was most related to a Gram-positive thermophile, Thermincola carboxydophila (99% similarity). The remainder of clones from the community was most related to T. carboxydophila, or uncultured Firmicutes and Deferribacteres. Overall, the data indicate that temperate aquatic sediments are a good source of thermophilic electrode-reducing bacteria.\",\n",

In Yaquina Bay, OR, two chambered BMFC prototypes generated current continuously for over 200 days. One BMFC was pumped intermittently, which produced power densities more than an order of magnitude greater than those achieved by previous BMFCs with single buried graphite-plate anodes. On average, the continuous power densities with pumping were 233 mW/m2 (2.3 W/m3); peak values were 380 mW/m2 (3.8 W/m3), and performance improved over the time of the deployments. Without pumping, high power densities could similarly be achieved after either BMFC was allowed to rest at open circuit. A third chambered BMFC with a 0.4 m2 footprint was deployed at a cold seep in Monterey Canyon, CA to test the new design in an environment with natural advection. The power density increased 5-fold (140 mW/m2 vs 28 mW/m2) when low-pressure check valves allowed unidirectional flow through the chamber.\",\n",

There is evidence that high-temperature processing of such materials can lead to diffusion of silver away from the coating surface, reducing the amount of available silver. In this study, we report the biofilm inhibition of a Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm using a low-temperature processed silver-doped phenyltriethoxysilane sol-gel coating. The incorporation of a silver salt into a sol-gel matrix resulted in an initial high release of silver in de-ionised water and physiological buffered saline (PBS), followed by a lower sustained release for at least 6 days-as determined by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS). The release of silver ions from the sol-gel coating reduced the adhesion and prevented formation of a S. epidermidis biofilm over a 10-day period. The presence of surface silver before and after 24 h immersion in PBS was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These silver-doped coatings also exhibited significant antibacterial activity against planktonic S. epidermidis. A simple test to visualise the antibacterial effect of silver release coatings on neighbouring bacterial cultures is also reported.\",\n",

At day 30, the supernatant consortium was partly transferred and used as inoculum for the evaluation of cultivation approach. Power output gradually increased to 9.9 mW m(-2) over 180 days, corresponding to coulombic efficiency (CE) of 29.6%. Separated biofilms attached anode enabled power output and CE dramatically up to 100.9 mW m(-2) and over 50%, respectively, whereas the residual sediment catalysed MFC gave a poor performance. MFC catalysed by in situ supernatant consortium demonstrated more than twice higher power than MFC catalysed by the supernatant consortium after Fe(OH)(3) cultivation. However, the re-generation of biofilms from the latter largely enhanced the cell performance.\\nMFC exhibited a more efficient inducement of electroactive consortium than Fe(OH)(3) cultivation. MFC performance varied depending on different inoculation strategies.\\nThis is the first time to study cultivation approach affecting electricity generation. In addition, anodic limitations of mass and electron transfer were discussed through MFC catalysed by sediment-based bio-matrix.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The reduction of oxygen at the cathode and the diffusion of protons from the anode to the cathode are currently perceived as two major bottlenecks of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). To address these issues, we have designed an MFC configuration in which the effluent of an acetate-fed anode was used as a feed for an aerated, biocatalysed cathode. The development of a cathodic biofilm achieved a four-fold increase of the current output compared with the non-catalysed graphite cathode, while the pH variation in the cathode compartment was reduced due to the additional transfer of protons via the liquid stream. The sequential anode-cathode configuration also provided for chemical oxygen demand (COD) polishing at the cathode by heterotrophic bacteria, with overall acetate removal consistently greater than 99%. The anode achieved an organic substrate removal of up to 2.45kg COD/m(3) of anode liquid volume per day, at Coulombic efficiencies of 65-95%. Electron balances at the cathode revealed that the main cathodic process was oxygen reduction to water with no significant Coulombic losses. The maximal power output during polarization was 110W/m(3) cathode liquid volume. The process could be operated in a stable way during more than 9 months of continuous operation. Excessive organic loading to the cathode should be avoided as it can reduce the long-term performance through the growth of heterotrophic bacteria.\",\n",

After 6 weeks of operation, 16S rRNA clone libraries were constructed from each anode biofilm. The pretreated anode exhibited a fourfold depletion in gamma-proteobacteria, a fourfold enrichment in delta-proteobacteria, a sixfold increase in sulfate reducers, a fivefold enrichment in unclassified micro-organisms, and 6% of the colonies were sulfur oxidizers while none were detected on the untreated anode.\\nAnode pretreatment significantly affects the anode-colonized microbial communities of MSBFCs.\\nThe MSBFC is one of a new class of microbial fuel cells in which the anode is spontaneously colonized by a subset of micro-organisms indigenous to a complex anaerobic mixture (such as sewage and food processing effluents). These micro-organisms utilize the anode as an oxidant, catalysing power generation by oxidizing fuel in the mixture and reducing the anode.

The method was implemented for the first time using the potential difference at the marine sediment/seawater interface as the only source of electric power. Graphite electrodes buried in marine sediment, developing a potential of -0.45 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), were used as anodes to cathodically polarize UNS S30403 stainless steel coupons that were exposed to seawater. The cathodic protection system was operated with low polarization of stainless steel, typically to -0.2 V (vs SCE) and was found to properly prevent material failure even in the presence of a well-developed biofilm. With voltammetry, the protection current was found to be related to the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds in the sediments. Results demonstrate that this inexpensive and environmentally friendly method can, so far, extend the service life of stainless steels in seawater.\",\n",

ESEM evidence of biofilm formation on GF is supported by substantial power density (per device cross-section) from the mini-MFC when using an acellular minimal media anolyte (1500 mW/m2). These experiments demonstrate that power density per volume for a biofilm flow reactor MFC should be calculated using the anode chamber volume alone (250W/m3), rather than with the full anolyte volume. Two oxygen reduction cathodes (uncoated GF or a Pt/vulcanized carbon coating on GF) were also compared to a cathode using uncoated GF and a 50mM ferricyanide catholyte solution. The Pt/C-GF (2-4% Pt by mass) electrodes with liquid cultures of DSP10 produced one order of magnitude larger power density (150W/m3) than bare graphite felt (12W/m3) in this design. These advances are some of the required modifications to enable the mini-MFC to be used in real-time, long-term environmental power generating situations.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro corrosion resistance in artificial saliva of two palladium-silver alloys (a Pd-Ag (Pors on 4) and an Ag-Pd (Palliag LTG)), with and without casting defects; 1 nickel-chrome alloy and 1 high-gold alloy, cast under recommended conditions, served as controls. For each of the palladium-based alloys, three specimens corresponding to three different casting conditions were used: under recommended conditions, with the use of a graphite-containing investment and crucible, and by reusing the sprues and sprue button. The electrochemical tests were run in Fusayama-Meyer artificial saliva. The open-circuit potential was recorded in mV/SCE at t=24h. Then, potentiodynamic polarization was performed to measure the polarization resistance (R(p)) in kOmega cm(2) and the corrosion current (i(corr)) in microA cm(-2). Data were evaluated with one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparisons test (alpha=0.05). In addition, each specimen was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Compared to the control alloys, the electrochemical experiments in artificial saliva indicated satisfactory corrosion resistance for the Pd-Ag and Ag-Pd alloys; these results are related to their high noble metal content and stable substructure. The Pd-Ag alloy displayed superior electrochemical properties to those of the Ag-Pd alloy regardless of the casting condition. The use of the graphite-containing crucible and investment during the cast process did not dramatically reduce the corrosion resistance values, but the reuse of sprues and the sprue button did. The optimal corrosion resistance values were obtained for the alloys cast according to the recommended conditions.\",\n",

In the anodic compartment, to facilitate the electron transfer from glucose to the graphite electrode, we added a redox mediator, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. We did not add any redox mediator to the cathodic compartment because the biomineralized manganese oxides were deposited on the surface of a graphite electrode and were reduced directly by electrons from the electrode. We have demonstrated that biomineralized manganese oxides are superiorto oxygen when used as cathodic reactants in microbial fuel cells. The current density delivered by using biomineralized manganese oxides as the cathodic reactant was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that delivered using oxygen. Several fuel cells were operated for 500 h, reaching anodic potentials of -441.5 +/- 31 mVscE and cathodic potentials of +384.5 +/- 64 mVscE. When the electrodes were connected by a 50 Ohms resistor, the fuel cell delivered the peak power density of 126.7 +/- 31.5 mW/m2.\",\n",

Current generation was dependent on several factors such as pH, resistance, electrolyte used, and dissolved oxygen concentration in the cathode compartment. The highest current was generated at pH 7. Under the operating conditions, the resistance was the rate-determining factor at over 500 omega. With resistance lower than 500 omega, proton transfer and dissolved oxygen (DO) supply limited the cathode reaction. A high strength buffer reduced the proton limitation to some extent. The DO concentration was around 6 mg l(-1) at the DO limited condition. The fact that oxygen limitation was observed at high DO concentration is believed to be due to the poor oxygen reducing activity of the electrode used, graphite. The current showed linear relationship with the fuel added at low concentration, and the electronic charge was well correlated with substrate concentration from up to 400 mg l(-1) of COD(cr). The microbial fuel cell might be used as a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) sensor.\",\n",

The obtained slides were projected on paper (10 X amplification) and the total and stained surfaces were outlined with graphite, cut off and weighed, in order to assess removal facility. The evaluation of antimicrobial effects was carried out by means of the method of diffusion in agar, and the results were obtained by measuring the length of the halos and rings. In terms of disclosing ability, the best solutions were 0.05% methylene blue, 5% erythrosin, 1% sodic fluorescein, Replak and 1% neutral red. One percent eosin, 1% sodic fluorescein and 5% erythrosin were the most easily removed solutions. One percent eosin, 5% erythrosin, 1% sodic fluorescein, 0.3% proflavine, Replak and 1% neutral red presented no antimicrobial effect. The solutions which presented the greatest disclosing ability and removal facility as well as absence of antimicrobial effect - which are essential requirements in the assessment of hygiene methods and guidance on oral health - were 1% eosin, 1% neutral red and 5% erythrosin.\",\n",
